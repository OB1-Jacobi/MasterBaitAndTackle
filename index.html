      you,

        <h4>Holden Hiscock</h4>
        <p>AKA "The Handy Man"</p>
        <p>Holden earned his moniker by having the most (ambi)dexterous digits in the Finger Lakes. Right or left hand,
          this man will have your rod ready, and doing things that you never knew it could do.</p>

        <h4>Anita Long-Schwanger</h4>
        <p>AKA "The Hooker"</p>
        <p>Anita was born on the Bayou, and has been hookin' for a livin' for as long as she can remember. She'll take
          you to places you've never been before, and doin' things you never imagined you'd ever do. Happy ending
          guaranteed.</p>

        <h4>Richard Cheese</h4>
        <p>AKA "Don't call me Dick!"</p>
        <p>Dick is the newest member of the Master Baiters, so enthralled by the skills that Holden and Anita possess,
          he refuses to stop until he until he's up on their level. For what he lacks in natural skill, he makes up in
          useless knowledge, and a complete lack of social skills. </p>
